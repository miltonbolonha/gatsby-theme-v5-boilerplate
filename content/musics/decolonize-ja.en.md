Let's decolonize our history <br />
Let's de-whiten our nation <br />
Reclaim native memory <br />
Disempower our boss

The light that illuminates <br />
The God that shakes the Sun <br />
Is made of dark matter <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings

Another faithful boy <br />
Who walked on foot <br />
Through alleys and lanes <br />
Dreamed of a life of luxury <br />
Away from the turmoil <br />
And also from the snares <br />
Since he was a child he stood out <br />
With a fortified mind <br />
Of the guys <br />
He confronted <br />
Every serpent <br />
That sneaks around the hood

He was in demand <br />
A tough kid <br />
To solve the confusion <br />
He wasn't involved <br />
But respected <br />
And loved by the population <br />
Always fighting, confiding <br />
With the cross in his chest <br />
Shield on his shirt <br />
Cellphone in hand <br />
Another devotee of the Roman Jesus

Let's decolonize our history <br />
Let's de-whiten our nation <br />
Reclaim native memory <br />
Disempower our boss

The light that illuminates <br />
The God that shakes the Sun <br />
Is made of dark matter <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings

I don't communicate with my surroundings <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings <br />
I don't communicate with my surroundings <br />
I don't communicate
