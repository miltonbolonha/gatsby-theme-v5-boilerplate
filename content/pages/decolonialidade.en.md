Hello, CTO kids!

Today we are going to talk about a very important and current term: decoloniality. This term refers to a very important idea: that colonization was cruel and still has negative effects on our societies today.

## What is decoloniality?

Decoloniality is a concept that has emerged in recent decades to challenge the colonial and neocolonial domination that has been imposed on many countries and peoples around the world. Decoloniality seeks to continuously decolonize thought, institutions, and social practices, questioning hegemonic forms of knowledge, power, and subjectivity.

Among the main characteristics of decoloniality are the pursuit of social justice, respect for cultural diversity, the valorization of knowledge produced by local communities, and the questioning of the hierarchies imposed by colonial domination. Decoloniality is an interdisciplinary approach that involves different areas of knowledge, including philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, among others.

## How did decoloniality arise?

When colonial forces imposed their will, they used military force, torture, and other forms of violence. They also established social hierarchies and ideologies that centered their own interests while denigrating others. This included prohibiting native languages, religions, and cultural practices, as well as denying education to all but a select few.

Decoloniality recognizes that the effects of these forms of cultural imperialism must be undone so that those who are descendants of colonial oppression can thrive.

## What is the difference between decoloniality and decolonization?

To fully understand decoloniality, it is important to understand that it is not the same as decolonization. Decolonization refers to the physical and political change in power between the colonizing powers and their future subjects. Decoloniality, on the other hand, is a mentality or praxis; it is an orientation for culture marked by a commitment to expel what remains of the colonial era in culture, education, society, etc.

Decoloniality teaches us to question dominant narratives that perpetuate colonization and to value the perspectives and knowledge of colonized peoples. This is especially important in the field of technology, where the contributions of minority groups are often ignored. We need a decolonial approach to build a more just and inclusive world.

## DECOLONIZE NOW!

I hope you enjoyed learning about decoloniality and that you can apply this mindset in your future careers. Remember to always question dominant narratives and value diversity of opinions.

See you next time and remember: DECOLONIZE NOW!
