Hello everyone!

April is known as Indigenous April, a special time to celebrate and value the culture and history of indigenous peoples. And I have an amazing proposal for all of you!

I invite all those who identify with the cause of indigenous peoples and their captive descendants in cities to participate in the recording of the music video for my latest song: DECOLONIZE JÁ! - A Love Story.

Participating is easy! Just record a video of yourself lip-syncing to the song Decolonize Já!, which is available at the link below. Then, send your recording to the email clipe@miltonbolonha.com.br and share this post widely!

Invite your friends and record together. Or if you prefer, film your video in the middle of the forest, using face paint or various accessories. Be creative!

The planned release date for the music video is 22/04/2023. So don't waste time and join us in this love story for the appreciation and respect of indigenous peoples.
