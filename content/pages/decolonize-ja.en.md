Let's decolonize our history
Let's de-whiten our nation
Reclaim native memory
Disempower our boss

The light that illuminates
The God that shakes the Sun
Is made of dark matter
I don't communicate with my surroundings
I don't communicate with my surroundings

Another faithful boy
Who walked on foot
Through alleys and lanes
Dreamed of a life of luxury
Away from the turmoil
And also from the snares
Since he was a child he stood out
With a fortified mind
Of the guys
He confronted
Every serpent
That sneaks around the hood

He was in demand
A tough kid
To solve the confusion
He wasn't involved
But respected
And loved by the population
Always fighting, confiding
With the cross in his chest
Shield on his shirt
Cellphone in hand
Another devotee of the Roman Jesus

Let's decolonize our history
Let's de-whiten our nation
Reclaim native memory
Disempower our boss

The light that illuminates
The God that shakes the Sun
Is made of dark matter
I don't communicate with my surroundings
I don't communicate with my surroundings

I don't communicate with my surroundings
I don't communicate with my surroundings
I don't communicate with my surroundings
I don't communicate with my surroundings
I don't communicate with my surroundings
I don't communicate
